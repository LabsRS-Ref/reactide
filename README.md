### Reactide is the first dedicated IDE for React application development.

## Get right to coding
Reactide runs an integrated Node server and custom browser simulator, which eliminates the need to configure servers, build-tools, and even offers hot module reloading right out of the box. Projects developed in Reactide are build-tool agnostic. allowing for only necceary dependancies to be added later as projects evolve as opposed to making decisions when the coding hasnâ€™t even begun.
